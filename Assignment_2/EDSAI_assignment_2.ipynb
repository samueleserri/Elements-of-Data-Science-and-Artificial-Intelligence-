More specifically, we collected data on how many Facebook users are interested in Computer Science (Look at this [guide](https://worldbank.github.io/connectivity_mapping/facebook_nbs/pipeline.html) to know more). These estimates come with both lower and upper bounds for the \"monthly active users\", or MAUs.\n",

    "In this study, we analyze the neighborhoods of Rotenbühl and Burbach in Saarbrücken using two distinct datasets to gain insights into different aspects of development. First, using the [Sentinel 2 Satellite Image Dataset](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/sentinel-2), we collected data on the NIR (Near-Infrared Reflectance) bands (B8 and B8A) for the neighborhoods of Rotenbühl and Burbach in Saarbrücken, for 2023 (both individual and combined). These bands serve as indicators of healthy vegetation, where higher values suggest more abundant vegetation. These indices, along with others, are often used to assess environmental aspects of development in a region.\n",

By comparing these areas, we aim to explore how satellite and Google reviews data correlate with socioeconomic factors and population demographics."
